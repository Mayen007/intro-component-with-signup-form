## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty, with a message saying _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_.
  - The email address is not formatted correctly, with a message saying _"Looks like this is not an email"_.

## My Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 markup**
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox** for layout
- **JavaScript** for form validation
- **Mobile-first workflow**

### What I Learned

This project helped me improve my form validation skills using JavaScript and practice designing responsive layouts. I also worked on improving accessibility by using semantic HTML elements.

Hereâ€™s an example of the custom error message logic I implemented:

```javascript
const email = document.getElementById("email");
const errorMessage = document.querySelector(".error-message");

if (email.value.trim() === "") {
  showError(email, errorMessages[2], "Email cannot be empty");
} else if (!isValidEmail(email.value.trim())) {
  showError(email, errorMessages[2], "Looks like this is not an email");
} else {
  clearError(email, errorMessages[2]);
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Enhance accessibility by focusing more on screen-reader-friendly labels.
- Explore using ARIA roles to improve the form's usability.
- Experiment with CSS animations for hover and focus states to enhance user experience.

### Useful Resources
